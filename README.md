## eye-messaging
### Here we will take the eye input, split the movement and map it to on-screen keyboard. --> Main reason to create this is for sliding texting.
### Note: Will also use CVPR2016 dataset [link](https://gazecapture.csail.mit.edu/download.php) 
# Flask covered eye messaging application to perform swipe text on virtual keyboard

#### Note: This is a learning and a potfilo building project and many steps will be included in this like
#### Few questions which came in mind before and during the project:
 - Why not use hand gesture?
    - Reason of not using hand gesture: 
        - a. Want to explore what you can do with eye tracking
        - b. Yes you can use hand gesture but imagine being looking and able to write when your hands are cutting vegetables or cleaning your washroom (haha just being sarcastic)

 - Analysing the large dataset
 - Selecting and narrowing the *problem statement*
 - What resources I would be using with what technical information is needed like flask, python, ML (*will keep more focus on ML*)
 - Will also include refrences too
